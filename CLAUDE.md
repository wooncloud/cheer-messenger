## Architecture Overview

This is a SvelteKit application for group-based praise/encouragement messaging, using Supabase as the backend service.

### Core Technology Stack

- **SvelteKit 2.0** with TypeScript for full-stack framework
- **Supabase** for authentication, database (PostgreSQL), and real-time features
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Vercel** deployment with Node.js 20.x runtime

### Authentication & Session Management

Authentication flows through Google OAuth via Supabase Auth:

- `src/hooks.server.ts` handles server-side session management
- Cookie-based sessions with secure configuration
- `src/lib/stores/auth.ts` manages client-side auth state
- Protected routes require authentication validation

### Database Architecture

PostgreSQL schema with Row Level Security (RLS) policies:

**Core Tables:**

- `users` - User profiles linked to Supabase Auth
- `groups` - Communities with configurable praise cooldown settings
- `group_members` - Role-based membership (admin/member)
- `praise_messages` - Core feature with emoji, message, privacy options
- `praise_cooldowns` - Anti-spam tracking with configurable intervals

**Key Business Logic:**

- Praise cooldown system (configurable from seconds to years)
- Self-praise prevention via database constraints
- Group capacity limits (1-1000 members)
- Anonymous and public/private praise options

### Data Access Pattern

Three-layer architecture:

1. **Utility Layer** (`src/lib/utils/`):
   - `groups.ts` - Group CRUD operations and membership
   - `praise.ts` - Praise system with cooldown validation
   - `members.ts` - Member management functions
   - `users.ts` - User profile and statistics functions
   - `auth.ts` - Authentication utilities
   - `time.ts` - Time formatting and utilities

2. **Type Layer** (`src/lib/database.types.ts`):
   - Auto-generated TypeScript types from Supabase schema
   - Helper types: `Tables<T>`, `Inserts<T>`, `Updates<T>`

3. **Client Layer** (`src/lib/supabase.ts`):
   - Configured Supabase client with typed database interface

### Component Architecture

Feature-based component organization:

```
src/lib/components/
├── dashboard/     # Group grid and cards
├── create-group/  # Multi-step group creation
├── group/        # Praise system UI
├── invite/       # Invitation flow
├── settings/     # Admin group management
├── profile/      # User profile components (stats, avatar, settings)
├── layout/       # Navigation and layout components
└── [common components]
```

Components follow Svelte's reactive patterns with TypeScript prop interfaces.

### Route Structure & Data Loading

File-based routing with server-side data loading:

- `+page.server.ts` files handle authenticated data fetching
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions in components
- Error handling through `+error.svelte` boundaries

**Navigation Structure:**

Three-tab bottom navigation (`AppNavigation.svelte`):
- **그룹** (`/dashboard`) - Main group listing and management
- **통계** (`/stats`) - Praise statistics and activity history  
- **MY** (`/profile`) - User profile and account settings

**Key Routes:**

- `/dashboard` - User's groups with member counts and praise stats
- `/stats` - Dedicated praise statistics and recent praise history
- `/profile` - User profile information and settings (separated from stats)
- `/group/[id]` - Group detail with real-time praise feed
- `/group/[id]/settings` - Admin-only group configuration
- `/invite/[code]` - Public invitation links with group preview

### State Management Strategy

**Server State:** Managed by Supabase with real-time subscriptions
**Client State:** Svelte stores for UI-specific state:

- `auth.ts` - Authentication state
- `toast.ts` - Notification system

### Real-time Features

Supabase real-time subscriptions for:

- Live praise message updates
- Member join/leave notifications
- Group setting changes

### Security Model

- RLS policies ensure users only access their group data
- Role-based permissions (admin vs member)
- Server-side validation with client-side optimistic updates
- Database constraints prevent business rule violations

### Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:

- `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key

### Korean Localization

The application is designed for Korean users:

- Korean language UI text
- Korean error messages and validation
- Cultural considerations in praise/encouragement system
